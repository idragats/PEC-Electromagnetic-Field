# PEC Electromagnetic Field
## Computational Electromagnetics

The purpose of this matlab code simulation is to study the one-dimensional wave equation during the propagation of the electromagnetic field.
We detected the differences beetwen outside and inside PEC (Perfect Electrical Conductor) conductor. 
We study skin depth concerning electromagnetic wave frequency, and we also study the electrical conductivity of the material (œÅ)
